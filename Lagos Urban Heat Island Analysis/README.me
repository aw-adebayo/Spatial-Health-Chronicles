# Lagos Urban Heat Island and Disease Outbreak Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding the urban heat island effect in Lagos, Nigeria, and its connection to disease outbreaks. We utilize remote sensing and GIS analysis to investigate the relationship between elevated urban heat and the risk of diseases like malaria and dengue fever.

## Key Findings

- We obtained land surface temperature data for Lagos using Landsat 8/9 satellite imagery. This data was processed to calculate land surface temperatures in degrees Celsius.
- The analysis revealed a significant urban heat island effect in Lagos, with temperatures exceeding 38°C.
- The connection between urban heat and disease outbreaks in Lagos is complex. Factors such as increased temperature and reduced green spaces in the city can intensify disease transmission, particularly for diseases like malaria and dengue fever.
- Studies have shown a clear link between temperature and the incidence of diseases, emphasizing the need for comprehensive approaches to disease prevention in urban areas like Lagos.

## Data Sources

We used the following satellite images for our analysis:

- [LandSat Image 1](#) - Date Acquired: 2023/08/08, Path: 191, Row: 055
- [LandSat Image 2](#) - Date Acquired: 2023/08/08, Path: 191, Row: 056
- [Satellite Image 3](#) - Date Acquired: 2023/08/09, Path: 190, Row: 056


## Conclusion

The findings of this project highlight the importance of addressing the urban heat island effect and its potential impact on disease outbreaks in Lagos. Effective measures, including improved urban planning, increased green spaces, and disease prevention campaigns, are essential to mitigate these challenges.
